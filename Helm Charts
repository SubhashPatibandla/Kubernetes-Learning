# What is Helm ?

Helm is a package manager for kubernetes, similar to apt package manager in linux.

usually we run Sudo apt update or sudo apt install nginx or phython3 etc inorder to install packages of nginx or phython3 as required.

similarly helm will help you to download the packages into kubernetes cluster, install them and update them as required.


what is repo in helm ?

There are some repositories available in the market which are helpful to get some commonly used charts in order to install , update or delete.

let's say you want to install nginx into one kubernetes cluster.

now first will add the repository to helm by using below command :

helm repo add bitnami.com

after adding the repo, will run the below command to install nginx :

helm install nginxv1 bitnami/nginx

in the above command, nginxv1 is the name of the package you wanted to name with.

bitnami/nginx is like repo/chart which you have downloaded/installed.

-- that's how helm is useful similar to apt in linux.

# then how the helm is useful at real world production level ?

usually we may need different setups at different environments.

so we can't write manifest files again and again for each microservice at every environment like dev, testing and prod.

so in order to make those manifest files reusable, we can update the data of manifest files as variable. 

and we can configure the values in the values.yaml separately for dev, testing and prod.

inorder to get clear understanding, please go through the below steps after writing manifest files for any microservice:
